# Stock-Prediction

## Stock market prediction based on news impact analysis

We propose an adaptive approach to predict the stock price based on news impact analysis. Our approach analyzes the impact of news over the stock price and makes prediction of its future price. The system then analyses time series and news information for potential concept drift detection and rebuilds the model by adapting new concepts. The outcome will be realistic and efficient stock price prediction and potential drift detection.
